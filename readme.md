## PERSONAL WEEKEND CHALLENGE

Hello fellow friend, this is just a simple project Kanban where you can add and move cards between 4 steps. I made this challenge to myself just to know if I can do developer things. I started my tech carrer at dev, but last years I`ve been working with infrastructure/sysadmin, cloud architecht and DevSecOps; so think about make this project gathering all the knowledge I have in dev and make on one weekend.

## SECOND PERSONAL CHALLENGE (because I started a homelab and I got excited)

So, this is the second part of this project. Basically I started a homelab after finished this project so I thought "why not put this app inside my infrastructure and host myself and protect myself the way I can?" Ok, let's do it.
